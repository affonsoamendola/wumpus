# wumpusVGA
A version of the classic Hunt the Wumpus for VGA PC-Compatibles running DOS made in 2018, for some great anachronism

Mainly used the help of this book to understand how the VGA systems worked, really recommend it https://archive.org/details/BlackArt3DEBook

I compiled it using Borland's Turbo C++ 3.0, so I dont really know if it works using any other compilers, I suppose Microsoft's C/C++ should work fine too.

Thanks for playing/being interested in this software.
